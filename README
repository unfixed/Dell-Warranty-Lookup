This tool is meant for the purpose of looking up dell warranty information using service tags without resorting to using Dell's webpage form.

Initially, I began working on this project under python, but I've since moved to powershell.
My reasons for doing this are I felt the number of individuals using this tool would more likely have a copy of powershell installed as opposed to python and its dependencies.

Currently, this tool allows you to perform the following actions:
- Lookup the Warranty End-date* of a single service tag.
- Lookup set of warranties from a .csv file. returns the following information:
  - Model
  - Service Tag
  - Shipdate
  - Warranty End-date*


* Currently, the Warranty Date being returned is the lastest warranty-service date and is currently agnostic of warranty service type.

Requirements:
This tool requires at least Powershell 2.0
If you would like to check your powershell version, use the following command within a Powershell console:
  $Host.Version


Installation:
In order to use this script after being downloaded, you must go its properties and click "unblock". Also you must have your powershell ExecultionPoilcy set to "RemoteSigned"
To set the ExecutionPolicy, open up a Powershell console as administrator and enter:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Remotesigned

Once the above has been done, simply run the script. (ex: right click the script, and run in powershell.)
