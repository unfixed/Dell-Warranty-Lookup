The purpose of this project will be to create a tool for looking up dell warranty information using service tags without resorting to using dell's webpage form.

Initially, I began working on this project under python, but I've since moved to powershell.
My reasons for doing this are I felt the number of individuals using this tool would more likely have a copy of powershell installed as opposed to python and its dependencies.

Currently, this tool allows you to perform the following actions:
- Lookup the Warranty End-date* of a single service tag.
- Lookup set of warranties from a .csv file. returns the following information:
  - Model
  - Service Tag
  - Shipdate
  - Warranty End-date*


* Currently, the Warranty Date being returned is the lastest warranty-service date and is currently agnostic of warranty service type.

Requirements:
This tool requires at least Powershell 2.0
If you would like to check your powershell version, use the following command within a Powershell console:
  $Host.Version
